# Traffic_Netra
Hackthon project - Codesprint , Team Mantis\
Here we are starting with the project .\
One of the main things that we need to do is to make a python code \so as to automate the downloading of thr required data files\ by "yolov" along with the coco names file which is basically a file where several objects which we might need to indentify through our\ project can be identified.


->We are importing the cv2, time and the threading modules .
->Writing the required functions takes us further \
towards the completion of our project.
